        <h1>Dearest Myiasha,</h1>

        <p>
            First I want to congratulate you on this milestone you've reached, a celebration of all your hard work
            and a heart for this calling. I know being a nursing student has been a challenging journey of your's, 
            but you have persevered with grace and determination. The CAP symbolizes your dedication and the strength 
            you've built along the way, the PIN represents  your commintment and the CANDLE reflects the light of compassion, 
            care and service you will carry to every patient you meet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Even though we've been in different school, taking different paths and barely seeing each other (once in a blue moon 
            lang HAHAHA), please know that I am always proud of all your hard work, sacrificies and dedication. I may not have 
            witnessed your sleepless nights, stressful exams, hospital duties or even the quiet moments when you doubted yourself. 
            I wasn't there to see the tears, the exhaustion, or the pressure you carried. But I want you to know that I have always 
            admired your strength, your determination and the soft heart you've always had for others. I have no doubt that you will 
            be an incredible nurse, not just because of your skills and knowledge, but because of the compassion and empathy that shines 
            through you.

        <p>
            Life may have taken us on different paths, but I am forever grateful that no mattter how busy we get, our friendship remains
            constant. Seeing you step closer to becoming a nurse reminds me of how far we've both grown—not just in our careers, but as 
            women chasing our dreams. You are not just becoming a nurse, you are becoming someone who will comfort strangers, ease pain
            and save lives. That candle you lit today symbolizes compassion, hope and service, I hope you never forget that your light is 
            unique, powerful and deeply needed in this world—but it also reminds me of the light you've always carried as my best friend. 
            Your kindness, your empathy and your unwavering support have been a guiding light in my life, and I know you will bring that 
            same light to everyone you care for as a nurse someday.
        </p>

        <p>
            I may not be physically present in  your journey, but I will always be here—supporting you, believing in you and celebrating
            every milestone with you, near or far. Again, congratulations my future RN. I am endlessly proud of you, and I can't wait
            to see the amazing nurse you will become. Keep shining, keep caring and keep being the incredible person you are. The world 
            is lucky to have you, and I am lucky to call you my best friend. I love you so much, and I am cheering for you every step of the way.
        </p>
